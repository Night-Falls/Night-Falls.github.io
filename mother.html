<h1>Mother 25th Restoration Hack</h1>
<p>I'm a huge fan of the Mother/Earthbound series of JRPGs, but Mother 1 has always had a lot of issues<br>
with balancing, random enemy encounters, etc.<br>
Most of these were fixed in the well-known Mother 25th Anniversary Edition, but this hack also changed all<br>
the graphics and some others things, making it more of a redux than a 'definitive' version of Mother.<br>
So I made a hack for the 25th anniversary edition that restores the game's original graphics, alongside a lot of<br>
other things like different trees in different areas, making Teddy's sprites not look weird, and making the <br>
Holy Loly Caves less of an absoloute nightmare.</p>
